```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(tidytable)
library(readr)
```

I'm back in business! After almost 5 months of hiatus, during which I was very busy with my new job, and 
new house, I'm in a position where I can write again. To celebrate my comeback, I'll introduce to
you the `{tidytable}` package, which I learned about this week on Twitter.

`{tidytable}` is a package that allows you to manipulate `data.table` objects with the speed of 
`{data.table}` and the convenience of the `{tidyverse}` syntax. My first reaction when I heard about
`{tidytable}` was *how is that different from `{dtplyr}`*? Well, `{dtplyr}` focuses on providing
a `{data.table}` backend for `{dplyr}`, while `{tidytable}` also allows you to use other `{tidyverse}`
verbs on `data.table` objects, for instance some `{tidyr}` and `{purrr}` verbs.

Another very interesting feature of `{tidytable}` is that it supports `{rlang}`, which means that 
you can program with `{tidytable}`, which, as far as I know, is not possible with `{dtplyr}` 
(but fact-check me on that please).

So to summarise, the speed of `{data.table}` and the syntax of the `{tidyverse}`, plus verbs for
`{tidyr}` and `{purrr}`? Sign me up!

To illustrate, I have downloaded a data set and wrote a function in both a `{tidyverse}` version
and a `{tidytable}` version. Even though it is true that `{tidytable}`'s syntax is very much, almost
the same as the regular `{tidyverse}` syntax, there are some minor differences. But more on that 
later. First, let's get the data, which you can find [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction).
Then, let's load the needed packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(tidytable)
library(readr)
```

and let's take a look at the data a little bit:

```{r}
energy <- read.csv("~/Downloads/energydata_complete.csv")

head(energy)
```

As you can see, this data is wide, and not long. Variables, or features, `T1` to `T9` provide the 
temperature of 9 rooms, and `RH_1` to `RH_9` provide the humidity of the same 9 rooms. 

What if I'd like to make a plot of each room's temperature throughout the year? In this format, 
it is not possible. So let's reshape this a little bit:

```{r}
flat_energy <- energy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("T\\d{1}"), names_to = "temperature", values_to = "temp_value") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("RH_\\d{1}"), names_to = "humidity", values_to = "hum_value") %>%
  mutate(temperature = case_when(temperature == "T1" ~ "kitchen",
                                 temperature == "T2" ~ "living",
                                 temperature == "T3" ~ "laundry",
                                 temperature == "T4" ~ "office",
                                 temperature == "T5" ~ "bathroom",
                                 temperature == "T6" ~ "north",
                                 temperature == "T7" ~ "ironing",
                                 temperature == "T8" ~ "teenager",
                                 temperature == "T9" ~ "parents")) %>%  
  mutate(humidity = case_when(humidity == "RH_1" ~ "kitchen",
                                 humidity == "RH_2" ~ "living",
                                 humidity == "RH_3" ~ "laundry",
                                 humidity == "RH_4" ~ "office",
                                 humidity == "RH_5" ~ "bathroom",
                                 humidity == "RH_6" ~ "north",
                                 humidity == "RH_7" ~ "ironing",
                                 humidity == "RH_8" ~ "teenager",
                              humidity == "RH_9" ~ "parents"))
```

As explained above, there are two variables that need this treatment; the temperature, and the humidity levels. In order
to plot the average monthly temperature in each room, I need to use `tidyr::pivot_longer()` (a 
little side note, I could have used `names_to = "room"`, instead of `"temperature"` and `"humidity"`,
but there's a reason for that. More on it below).

Now let's plot it:

```{r}
flat_energy %>%
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>%  
  group_by(month, temperature) %>%
  summarise(avg_temp = mean(temp_value)) %>%  
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_temp, x = month, col = temperature)) +
  brotools::theme_blog()
```
Ok great. But what if I had such a dataset per house for a whole city? How many datasets would that
be? And how long would these operations take? 
The first step I would take if I were in this situation, would be to write a function. I would make
it general enough to work with temperature or humidity. Below is this function:

```{r}
prepare_data <- function(energy, variable){

  variable <- enquo(variable)

  variable_label <- as_label(variable)

  regex_selector <- ifelse(variable_label == "temperature",
                           "T\\d{1}",
                           "RH_\\d{1}")
energy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = matches(regex_selector),
               names_to = variable_label,
               values_to = paste0(variable_label, "_value")) %>%
    mutate(!!(variable) := case_when(grepl("1$", !!(variable)) ~ "kitchen",
                                    grepl("2$", !!(variable)) ~ "living",
                                    grepl("3$", !!(variable)) ~ "laundry",
                                    grepl("4$", !!(variable)) ~ "office",
                                    grepl("5$", !!(variable)) ~ "bathroom",
                                    grepl("6$", !!(variable)) ~ "outside",
                                    grepl("7$", !!(variable)) ~ "ironing",
                                    grepl("8$", !!(variable)) ~ "teenager",
                                    grepl("9$", !!(variable)) ~ "parents")) %>%
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>%  
  group_by(month, !!(variable)) %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = ends_with("_value"),
                   .fns = mean),
            .groups = "drop")
}
```

This function does exactly the same thing as above:

```{r}
prepare_data(energy, temperature) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(y = temperature_value, x = month, col = temperature)) +
  brotools::theme_blog()
```

As you can see, I have the exact same plot. What's nice with this function, is that it uses many
verbs from the `{tidyverse}` as well as the tidy eval framework for non-standard evaluation (
which is why I did not use `names_to = "room"`, I wanted to use the variable label defined with
`as_label()` and see if it works with `{tidytable}` as well).
Ok, so now let's imagine that I'm happy with this function, but I'd like it to run faster, and because
I'm lazy, the less I have to modify it, the happier I am. This is where `{tidytable}` looks very 
promising. Let's rewrite the function to make it work with `{tidytable}`:

```{r}
prepare_data_dt <- function(energy, variable){

  variable <- enquo(variable)

  variable_label <- as_label(variable)

  regex_selector <- ifelse(variable_label == "temperature",
                           "T\\d{1}",
                           "RH_\\d{1}")
energy %>%
  pivot_longer.(cols = matches(regex_selector),
               names_to = variable_label,
               values_to = paste0(variable_label, "_value")) %>%
    mutate.(!!(variable) := case_when(grepl("1$", !!(variable)) ~ "kitchen",
                                    grepl("2$", !!(variable)) ~ "living",
                                    grepl("3$", !!(variable)) ~ "laundry",
                                    grepl("4$", !!(variable)) ~ "office",
                                    grepl("5$", !!(variable)) ~ "bathroom",
                                    grepl("6$", !!(variable)) ~ "outside",
                                    grepl("7$", !!(variable)) ~ "ironing",
                                    grepl("8$", !!(variable)) ~ "teenager",
                                    grepl("9$", !!(variable)) ~ "parents")) %>%  
  mutate.(month = month(date)) %>%  
  summarise_across.(.cols = ends_with("_value"),
                    .fns = mean,
                    .by = c(month, !!(variable))) %>%  
  ungroup()
}
```

As you can see, it's *almost* the same thing. `{tidytable}` verbs end with a `'.'` and that's 
it. Well almost (again), the biggest difference is how `{tidytable}` groups by a variable. It's very 
similar to how it's done in `{data.table}`, by using a `.by = ` argument to verbs that support it,
such as `summarise_across()` (which is also, by the way, another difference with standard 
`{tidyverse}` syntax). While I'll have to remember these, I'd argue that they're minor differences
and if it can make my function run faster, I don't mind!

Now let's run a little benchmark. But first, let's define our data as a `tidytable` object:

```{r}
energy_tidytable <- as_tidytable(energy)
```

Now we're good to go:


```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
                  energy %>%
                  prepare_data(temperature),
                  energy_tidytable %>%
                  prepare_data_dt(temperature),
                  times = 10
                )
```

That is nice! It does indeed run faster, and with only some minor changes to the function! And 
how about using some more cores to run this function?
This can be done using `data.table::setDTthreads(n_cores)` where `n_cores` is the number of 
cores you want to use:

```{r}
data.table::setDTthreads(12)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
                  energy %>%
                  prepare_data(temperature),
                  energy_tidytable %>%
                  prepare_data_dt(temperature),
                  times = 10
                )
```

Maybe surprisingly, it did not run faster. It could very well be that my function does not really
lend itself to running in parallel, and the overhead induced by distributing the work to the 
cpu cores cancels out the gains from running it in parallel. But in any case, this is really looking 
very interesting. I have not tested the whole package yet, but
since the syntax is so similar to the `{tidyverse}`, you can try really quickly to see if the `{tidytable}`
version of the function runs faster, and if yes, I don't really see a reason not to use it!
